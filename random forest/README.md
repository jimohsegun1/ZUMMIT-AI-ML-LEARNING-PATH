# About the Data

The dataset contains information about individuals' **heights** and **weights**, structured as follows:
- **Index**: A unique identifier for each individual (not relevant for prediction).
- **Height**: The height of the individual (measured in inches).
- **Weight**: The weight of the individual (measured in pounds).

This data provides a straightforward example to explore machine learning techniques.

# What Do We Want to Achieve?

Our primary goal is to build a **machine learning model** that can predict a person’s **weight** based on their **height**.

## Why Random Forest?

Random Forest is a flexible and powerful machine learning algorithm that can capture complex, non-linear relationships between height and weight. It works by building multiple decision trees and aggregating their predictions, reducing errors caused by overfitting or assumptions about linearity.

## What Will the Model Do?

1. **Learn** the relationship between height and weight from the data.
2. **Predict** a person’s weight given their height.

# How This Helps

Understanding the relationship between height and weight can be useful for:
- Estimating weight when scales or direct measurements are unavailable.
- Building fitness or health tracking applications.
- Providing insights for personalized health recommendations.
